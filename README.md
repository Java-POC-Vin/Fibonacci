## Fibonacci

A Fibonacci sequence is e in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
This project experiments with separating classes for organizing functions in Java.

## How to use

1. Go to ./src/App.java

2. Change the follow variable value to a desired number of sequences:
```
int seq = 10;
```

3. Run the script.

It will print in console the sequence amount in a Fibonacci sequence.

## Output example
```java
// Output example for sequence = 5
0 1 1 2 3

// Output example for sequence = 10
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

// Output example for sequence = 20
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 2584 4181
```
